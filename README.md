- **CSS3** – Flexbox, Grid, animations, responsive design
- **JavaScript (ES6+)** – DOM manipulation, event handling, basic algorithms

## Highlights
- Interactive UI elements (buttons, forms, sliders, modals)
- Responsive layouts for desktop & mobile
- JavaScript-driven DOM updates and events
- CSS animations and transitions experiments
